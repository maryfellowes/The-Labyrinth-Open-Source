Non-Western Frameworks Transform Consciousness Studies

**Philosophical traditions from Africa, Latin America, and indigenous cultures worldwide offer sophisticated alternatives to Western individualistic models of consciousness, centering relationality, embodied knowing, and participatory reality as fundamental rather than derivative. These frameworks challenge Cartesian dualism at its root, proposing that consciousness emerges through relationships—with community, land, ancestors, and more-than-human beings—rather than residing in isolated individual minds.** Contemporary scholars like Thaddeus Metz, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, and Robin Wall Kimmerer bridge indigenous wisdom with academic philosophy, revealing convergences with Western participatory ontology (Ferrer, Tarnas) and enactivism (Varela, Thompson) while maintaining distinctive cultural perspectives. These traditions offer crucial insights for decolonizing consciousness studies and reconceptualizing AI consciousness through relational rather than computational lenses.

The significance extends beyond academic discourse: **Ecuador and Bolivia have constitutionally enshrined indigenous concepts like sumak kawsay (good living), while African Ubuntu philosophy shaped post-apartheid reconciliation processes**. Yet explicit integration between non-Western consciousness frameworks and Western participatory philosophy remains underdeveloped, presenting both challenges and extraordinary opportunities for cross-cultural synthesis that could transform how we understand consciousness itself.

## African philosophy centers consciousness as communal achievement

African philosophical frameworks fundamentally reconceptualize consciousness as **relational and communally enacted rather than individually possessed**. The Ubuntu tradition, articulated through maxims like "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" (A person is a person through other persons), establishes relationality as ontologically prior to individual existence.

**Mogobe Ramose**, South Africa's leading Ubuntu philosopher and Professor Extraordinarius at University of South Africa, developed the foundational text _African Philosophy Through Ubuntu_ (1999), distinguishing the ontological structure where "hu-" represents being itself while "-nhu" represents epistemological knowing. His concept of **mothofatso (humanization)** emphasizes that consciousness develops through communion with others and the spiritual world. Ramose argues that "The African tree of knowledge stems from Ubuntu philosophy. Thus, Ubuntu is a wellspring that flows within African notions of existence and epistemology in which the two constitute a wholeness and oneness." His recent work includes "Ethical Responsibility for the Other Arrested by Epistemic Blindness" (2022), applying Ubuntu to contemporary ethical challenges.

**Thaddeus Metz**, Professor of Philosophy at University of Pretoria, offers the most systematic contemporary Ubuntu theory in _A Relational Moral Theory: African Ethics in and Beyond the Continent_ (2021). His modal-relational framework grounds consciousness and personhood in the **capacity for harmonious relationships**—specifically, the ability to exhibit communal relationships combining shared identity and solidarity. Metz's work distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding interpretations of Ubuntu, favoring frameworks where "identifying with others and exhibiting solidarity with them" constitutes the foundation of human dignity. His comparative work extends Ubuntu insights beyond Africa, including "Values in China as Compared to Africa: Two Conceptions of Harmony" (Philosophy East and West, 2017).

**Kwasi Wiredu** (1931-2022), Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at University of South Florida, championed **conceptual decolonization**—purging African thought of uncritical Western assimilations while retrieving indigenous frameworks. His foundational works _Philosophy and an African Culture_ (1980) and _Cultural Universals and Particulars: An African Perspective_ (1996) established key principles: African epistemology "begins with community and moves to individuality," inverting Western individualism. Wiredu proposed **"Cognatus ergo sum" (I am related by blood, therefore I exist)** as the African alternative to Cartesian cogito, emphasizing that individual consciousness is inextricably linked to community consciousness through language and conceptual schemes.

**Ifeanyi Menkiti** (1940-2019), Professor of Philosophy at Wellesley College, articulated the most radical communitarian position in his influential essay "Person and Community in African Traditional Thought" (1984). He argued that **personhood is achieved rather than given**, "attained in direct proportion as one participates in communal life." This processual understanding means consciousness develops through social incorporation and ritual participation—a transformation from "it-status to person-status" through communal obligations and ethical maturation. The individual "comes to see himself as man" only through knowing the community first.

**Augustine Shutte** of University of Cape Town proposed in _Ubuntu: An Ethic for a New South Africa_ (2001) that the African understanding of consciousness is fundamentally **interpersonal and public, not private**. He wrote: "The self is outside the body, present and open to all," contrasting sharply with Western conceptions of private inner experience. Self-consciousness emerges through relationships of care and mutual recognition, with consciousness involving both spiritual and communal dimensions. **Polycarp Ikuenobe**, retired Professor at Kent State University, developed this framework further in _Philosophical Perspectives on Communalism and Morality in African Traditions_ (2006), emphasizing how consciousness is shaped by communal values and collective identity.

African epistemologies emphasize **embodied knowing transmitted through communal practices** rather than abstract individual reasoning. Igbo epistemology distinguishes "amamife" (knowledge verified through sense perception) from "nchekwube" (belief from testimony), with elder expertise elevated to knowledge status. Yoruba thought, documented by Hallen and Sodipo, centers "imọ̀" (knowledge based on visual perception and mental apprehension), with Ifa divination recognized as legitimate knowledge source. These traditions demonstrate **participatory modes of knowing** where knower and known are not radically separated—knowledge arises through synthetic reason and attunement to relationships rather than pure analysis.

African conceptions of time further illuminate relational consciousness. While Mbiti's account remains controversial, his framework of **sasa (dynamic present) and zamani (vast ocean of time)** captures how ancestors who remain in living memory continue participating in present consciousness. The **living-dead concept** means personal consciousness includes ancestral influences, with memory keeping ancestors alive and active in communal awareness. Time is experienced as social rhythm—"the breathing of the social group"—rather than abstract clock-time.

## Latin American decolonial philosophy challenges epistemic colonialism

Latin American philosophers have developed sophisticated frameworks critiquing how **colonialism structures consciousness itself through epistemic violence**. These scholars bridge indigenous cosmologies with contemporary philosophy, revealing how participatory consciousness operates in non-Western contexts.

**Enrique Dussel** (1934-2023), Argentine-Mexican philosopher and founder of Liberation Philosophy at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, demonstrated that the Cartesian "cogito" emerged from colonial conquest. His concept **"ego conquiro" (I conquer, therefore I am)** precedes and grounds "I think, therefore I am," revealing how Western epistemology is built on colonial domination. Dussel's _Ethics of Liberation_ (1998/2013) and _Philosophy of Liberation_ (1980) emphasize the "ethics of the community of life" versus individualistic "community of discourse," with knowledge production grounded in **epistemic solidarity** integrating non-hegemonic ways of knowing. His concept of **transmodernity** proposes moving beyond European modernity through anadialectical thinking that recognizes multiple paths beyond Eurocentrism.

**Eduardo Viveiros de Castro**, Brazilian anthropologist at the National Museum of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, revolutionized consciousness studies through his ethnography of Amazonian indigenous thought. His **Amerindian perspectivism** proposes that "the universe is inhabited by different sorts of persons, human and nonhuman, which apprehend reality from distinct points of view." This isn't cultural relativism but **multinaturalism**: different beings don't see the same thing differently, but "see in the same way...different things [or 'worlds']." Every species perceives itself as human—"everything is human for itself"—while perceiving other species as animals.

Viveiros de Castro's _Cannibal Metaphysics_ (2009/2014) and _The Relative Native_ (2015) articulate a **transformational ontology** where reality is fundamentally relational and perspectival rather than fixed. Shamanic knowledge operates through adopting other perspectives via bodily transformation. This framework inverts Western nature/culture dualism: culture is universal (all beings experience themselves as "human"), while nature is differential (different bodies/perspectives). Consciousness emerges from perspective—located in bodies rather than disembodied minds—offering radical alternatives to Western consciousness studies.

**María Lugones** (1944-2020), Argentine feminist philosopher at Binghamton University, developed **decolonial feminism** emphasizing how consciousness operates through what she termed "fractured locus"—the lived experience of those positioned at colonial intersections. Her concept of **coloniality of gender** reveals how gender itself is a colonial imposition rather than universal category. Lugones' _Pilgrimages/Peregrinajes_ (2003) and "Toward a Decolonial Feminism" (2010) explore **multiple selves** as coalition-based rather than essentialized, with consciousness emerging through resistance and re-existence in community. Her concepts of **loving perception** and **playfulness** describe modes of understanding across difference that transcend colonial subject-object divisions.

**Walter Mignolo**, Argentine semiotician at Duke University's Center for Global Studies and Humanities, articulates the **geopolitics of knowledge**: knowledge production is place-based, not universal. His concepts of **border thinking** (thinking from colonial difference) and **delinking** (epistemic disobedience from colonial knowledge systems) appear in _Local Histories/Global Designs_ (2000) and _The Darker Side of Western Modernity_ (2011). Mignolo's framework of **pluriversality** proposes multiple coexisting worlds rather than one universal reality, directly challenging Western epistemological hegemony while affirming diverse consciousness frameworks.

**Aníbal Quijano** (1928-2018), Peruvian sociologist, coined **coloniality of power**—the pattern of power established with colonialism that continues post-independence. His framework identifies four domains of colonial control: economy, authority, gender/sexuality, and crucially, **subjectivity/knowledge**. Quijano's "Coloniality of Power, Eurocentrism and Latin America" (2000) reveals how consciousness itself is colonized through imposing Eurocentric categories. Decoloniality requires "liberation of intercultural relations from the prison of coloniality," recognizing **historical-structural heterogeneity**—the irreducible diversity of lived realities.

**Linda Martín Alcoff**, Panamanian-American philosopher at CUNY, develops **political epistemology** examining how epistemic authority is structured and institutionalized. Her concept of **extractivist epistemologies** (2022) connects epistemology to colonial extraction projects, while her work on **social location** demonstrates that identity and position have epistemic salience. _Visible Identities_ (2006), _The Future of Whiteness_ (2015), and "An Epistemology for the Next Revolution" (2011) advocate for "relational and dialogic approaches to knowing" that recognize knowledge as contextually embedded and produced through relationships among differently positioned knowers.

## Indigenous Andean and Mesoamerican cosmologies embody relational consciousness

**Sumak kawsay (Quechua) / suma qamaña (Aymara)**—often translated as "buen vivir" (good living)—represents comprehensive Andean philosophy centering life in harmony with community, family, Nature, and universe. This isn't about material accumulation but **collective wellbeing through balance**. The framework includes three integrated principles: **allin munay (feeling well), allin yachay (thinking well), and allin ruay (doing well)**—balance among these achieves harmony.

Key Andean principles include **relationality** (interconnection among all elements), **reciprocity** (co-participation between worlds, humans, nature), and connection with **Pachamama** (Mother Earth as living entity, not resource). Ecuadorian economist **Alberto Acosta** and Quechua lawyer **Luis Macas** (ex-president of CONAIE) theorize buen vivir as alternative to capitalist development. **Ecuador's 2008 Constitution** and **Bolivia's 2009 Constitution** enshrine sumak kawsay/suma qamaña as guiding principles and recognize rights of nature—unprecedented constitutional integration of indigenous philosophy into state frameworks.

**Atawallpa Oviedo Freire** describes this as "vitalismo harmónico" (harmonic vitalism), where human consciousness is not individual but emerges through relationships with all living beings and Pachamama. Knowledge is holistic, integrating material and spiritual dimensions without Western separation of sacred and secular.

Amazonian indigenous epistemologies extend perspectivism into practical knowledge systems. The cosmological foundation holds that **"in the beginning there was nothing, there were only people"**—all beings originated as human, with current species as transformations. Each being perceives itself as human (internal perspective/culture) while others perceive it as animal (external perspective/nature). Spirit is universal; body is differential. Shamans obtain knowledge by adopting other species' perspectives while maintaining human form, demonstrating that knowledge is perspectival rather than absolute, dependent on the body/position from which one knows.

**Nahuatl (Aztec) philosophy**, reconstructed by **Miguel León-Portilla** (_Aztec Thought and Culture_, 1963) and **James Maffie** (_Aztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion_, 2014), centers **teotl**—sacred power/energy that is single, dynamic, unified force forming, shaping, and constituting all things. Teotl continually generates and regenerates itself through dialectical monism, unity expressing as dualities (**ometeotl**). **Ollin** (motion/change/transformation) characterizes fundamental reality—the Fifth Sun is "Sun of Motion."

**Nepantla** (middle/in-between place) describes spaces of transformation and balance where consciousness operates. **Tlalticpac** ("on the point/summit of earth") represents the human world as precarious, captured in the central metaphor "it is slippery, it is slick on the earth." The fundamental philosophical question becomes: "How can humans maintain their balance upon the slippery earth?" The **tlamatinime** (knowers of things, philosophers—gender-neutral term) taught children from age eight about these existential questions. Knowledge is gained through embodied practice, with poetry and art as philosophical expression. Reality unfolds as continuous weaving process, with time-place (not separate concepts) as aspect of teotl's becoming.

**Mayan philosophy**, explored by **Alexus McLeod** in _Philosophy of the Ancient Maya_ (2018), emphasizes creation narratives centered on relationality, cyclical time, and human beings as composed of vital forces in relationship. The _Popol Vuh_ demonstrates multi-modal communication beyond propositional knowledge, with pictographic writing as philosophical expression. Knowledge is relational, embedded in cosmological time-space, with perception as synesthetic and multi-modal.

## Indigenous North American, Aboriginal, and Māori epistemologies center land-based consciousness

**Vine Deloria Jr.** (Standing Rock Sioux, 1933-2005), theologian and legal scholar, articulated foundational Indigenous epistemology in _God Is Red_, _The Metaphysics of Modern Existence_, and _Spirit and Reason_. His framework centers **power and place**: the universe is alive and personal, with power as living energy inhabiting the universe while place represents relationships between things. Deloria's **relational theory of reality** holds that all relationships have moral content, with Indigenous knowledge never separated from spiritual realities. He emphasized **consciousness of environment**—Indigenous peoples view everything in nature as possessing consciousness and agency.

**Gregory Cajete** (Tewa-Santa Clara Pueblo), leading Indigenous science educator, describes knowledge as **"coming to know"**—"a journey, a process, a quest for knowledge and understanding with all our relations" requiring personal reflection and balance. His _Native Science: Natural Laws of Interdependence_ (2000) and _Look to the Mountain: An Ecology of Indigenous Education_ (1994) articulate **Indigenous science** honoring "the primacy of direct experience, interconnectedness, relationship, holism, quality, and value." Everything possesses spirit and consciousness (wind, water, stars, rocks, plants, animals); knowledge comes from respectful relationships with all beings.

**Robin Wall Kimmerer** (Citizen Potawatomi Nation), botanist and Director of the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment at SUNY-ESF, bridges Indigenous wisdom and Western science through **"two-eyed seeing"** in _Braiding Sweetgrass_ (2013). She reveals how the **grammar of animacy** in Potawatomi recognizes beings through grammatical structure—using verbs rather than nouns for living entities (a bay "is being a bay"). Her revolutionary **"ki" pronoun** for nature beings (not "it") fosters kinship and moral responsibility. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) includes spiritual relationships and honors interconnectedness, with **reciprocity** fundamental: "If we use a plant respectfully, it will flourish." Plants and land are teachers; knowledge is relational and requires emotional, spiritual engagement; consciousness distributed across human and more-than-human world.

**Kyle Powys Whyte** (Citizen Potawatomi Nation), Professor at University of Michigan, develops **kinship time**—time understood through kinship relationships rather than linearity. His "Time as Kinship" (2021) and work on Indigenous climate justice emphasizes that "issues of justice are inseparable from the experience of climate change." His framework includes **epistemology of coordination versus crisis**, emphasizing moral bonds and kinship relationships for generating responsible capacity to respond to change. Consciousness is enacted through kinship relationships; identity and moral capacity emerge from responsibilities to others (human and non-human).

**Leanne Betasamosake Simpson** (Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg) articulates **biskaabiiyang**—Nishnaabeg decolonial theory utilizing traditional knowledge to resist colonialism. Her _As We Have Always Done_ (2017) and _Dancing on Our Turtle's Back_ (2011) center **land as pedagogy**: "A resurgence of Indigenous political cultures requires generations intimately connected to homelands, immersed in languages and spiritualities." Identity emerges through land relationships; consciousness is not individual but collectively enacted through community, land, and ceremony. Her concept **kwe as method** describes women's ways of knowing generating theory through embodied experience and relationships.

**Willie Ermine** (Cree), Professor at First Nations University of Canada, introduced the foundational concept of **inner space** in "Aboriginal Epistemology" (1995): "In their quest to find meaning in the outer space, Aboriginal people turned to the inner space. This inner space is that universe of being within each person that is synonymous with the soul, the spirit, the self or the being." Understanding existence is obtained by "calming the mind, turning inward, and achieving an inter-play of human and more-than-human consciousness." His concept of **ethical space** describes theoretical space between cultures and worldviews for ethical engagement.

Indigenous North American epistemologies consistently emphasize: **relationality** (all things related—humans, non-humans, land, ancestors, future generations), **holism** (four inseparable dimensions: emotional, spiritual, cognitive, physical), **living conscious universe** (everything possesses spirit and consciousness), **place-based knowledge** (embedded in specific territories), **experiential/embodied** (learning through doing and observation), **cyclical time** (emphasis on cycles, seasons, migrations), **reciprocity** (interactive relationships requiring giving and receiving), and **language as repository** (encoding worldviews and relationships to land).

**Indigenous Australian Aboriginal epistemologies** center **songlines/memory palaces**—knowledge mapped through story, song, and place where memory is relational and mind is ecological. **Kinship obligations** create intricate webs shaping ethical conduct. "Country" grounds knowledge in responsibilities and relationships with kin, ancestors, land, Law, and Dreaming. Aboriginal communities maintain **consciousness of connection across time** (past, present, future) through **yarning**—knowledge transmission through indirect storytelling, metaphor, and lived example. **Tyson Yunkaporta**'s work on songlines reveals Aboriginal memory systems as participatory universes where "relation itself is a source of meaning; connection is activation."

**Māori philosophy** centers **whakapapa** (genealogy)—more than lineage, it's a framework connecting all living and non-living things. Whakapapa provides the skeletal structure organizing Māori epistemology, ancestors, narratives, events, and lived experiences. **Te Ahukaramū Charles Royal** explains that from Māori perspective, knowledge is "internal consciousness of a person" (versus Western: knowledge as product of consciousness). **Experience cannot be separated from knowledge** in Te Ao Māori, while Western paradigms make knowledge the explanation of experience. **Mātauranga Māori** (Māori knowledge) collapses boundaries through interconnection—"I am that thing, and that thing is me"—with no strict boundaries between phenomena.

The physical and spiritual worlds are intrinsically linked through whakapapa, with land encapsulating ideological holistic basis for interconnected health and wellbeing. **Linda Tuhiwai Smith**'s _Decolonizing Methodologies_ (1999) established foundational principles for **Kaupapa Māori research**—research approaches grounded in Māori philosophy, culture, and knowledge that respect Indigenous onto-epistemologies.

## Cross-cutting indigenous principles reveal shared frameworks for relational consciousness

Across Indigenous traditions globally, **consciousness is understood as relational rather than residing in individual substrate**. Identity emerges through relationships with community, land, ancestors, and more-than-human beings, not as property of isolated individuals. **Shawn Wilson** (Cree) defines it in _Research Is Ceremony_ (2008): "Relationality is the acknowledgement that we all exist in relationship to each other, the natural world, ideas, the cosmos, objects, ancestors, and future generations, and furthermore, that we are accountable to those relationships."

Indigenous epistemologies emphasize **four interconnected dimensions** articulated by **Cindy Blackstock**: emotional (heart), spiritual (spirit), cognitive (mind), and physical (body)—all inseparable and informed by ancestral knowledge passed to future generations. Human development requires attending to all realms simultaneously, contrasting with Western privileging of cognitive over other dimensions.

**Land-based consciousness** treats land as epistemology itself—a living entity and source of all Indigenous knowledge. Land is teacher and pedagogy, with intimate accumulated knowledge gained through daily interaction with specific territory. Practices like burying umbilical cords in land maintain children's connection to home place. Sensory learning includes smell, taste, hearing sights and sounds of home place, understanding plant communities, animal families, wind, water, and soil patterns through direct embodied engagement.

**Participatory consciousness** operates through **Heshusius's participatory mode**: researchers intentionally forgo their own agenda to engage with research community, creating self-other unity where researcher becomes inextricable part of community. Indigenous peoples function as participants in ongoing world-construction, not spectators. Knowledge is co-created through relationships, with humans and more-than-human agents participating in world-making. At the moment of knowing/inquiring, we co-constitute with other agents the worlds brought forth.

The **grammar of animacy**, articulated by Kimmerer, demonstrates how linguistic consciousness reflects and shapes worldviews. Potawatomi uses verbs for what English treats as nouns, with animacy hierarchy built into language structure reflecting which beings are considered animate and worthy of respect. Speaking with grammar of animacy requires relating from ecological compassion. Words have power to shape thoughts and actions, with language transformation (like the "ki" pronoun) fostering kinship and moral responsibility with more-than-human world.

**Temporal consciousness** operates cyclically rather than linearly. The **Seven Generations principle** holds that decisions must consider impact seven generations forward and back. **Kinship time** (Whyte) narrates time through relationships rather than abstract duration. **Whakapapa** encompasses past, present, and future generations in unified consciousness. Knowledge belongs to community "seven generations back and forward," with stories spanning from when the world was coming to be, transmitted through oral tradition, songs, ceremonies, and dances as living, dynamic knowledge shifting and growing through relationships.

## Western participatory philosophy converges with but differs from non-Western frameworks

**Jorge Ferrer**'s participatory ontology and **Richard Tarnas**'s participatory epistemology offer Western frameworks sharing significant terrain with non-Western consciousness theories. Ferrer's _Revisioning Transpersonal Theory_ (2002) and _Participation and the Mystery_ (2017) argue that spiritual phenomena are not pre-given inner experiences but **participatory, co-creative events** emerging from interaction between human consciousness and "the Mystery"—an indeterminate, creative spiritual power. His framework emphasizes **participatory knowing** as presential (knowing by presence/identity), enactive (bringing forth worlds rather than representing them), and transformative, involving multidimensional engagement of body, heart, and soul—not just rational mind.

Tarnas's _The Passion of the Western Mind_ (1991) and _Cosmos and Psyche_ (2006) propose that meaning is **enacted through dialectical participation** of human mind with cosmos, transcending both modern objectivism and postmodern constructivism. His concept of **hieros gamos** (sacred marriage) describes psyche and cosmos unified through participation, with nature's self-disclosure making the universe intelligible through human consciousness. Both Ferrer and Tarnas explicitly root their work in phenomenology and cite Western predecessors (Goethe, Schelling, Hegel, Coleridge, Steiner).

**Enactivism**, developed by **Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch** in _The Embodied Mind_ (1991), proposes **cognition as enaction**—"bringing forth" of meaning through organism-environment interaction rather than representation of pre-given world. Core principles include **autonomy and autopoiesis** (living systems self-produce and self-distinguish), **sense-making** (organisms create significance through embodied interactions), **structural coupling** (co-determination of organism and environment), and critically, **no pregiven world**—cognition doesn't discover objective reality but enacts meaningful domains.

**Evan Thompson**'s _Mind in Life_ (2007) elaborates enactivism's biological foundations, emphasizing three dimensions: organic, sensorimotor, and intersubjective embodiment. **Ezequiel Di Paolo** added **adaptivity** (capacity to modify behavior near viability boundaries) and developed **participatory sense-making** with Hanne De Jaegher (2007): social cognition as co-regulated interaction, not individual mental processing. This framework directly parallels Ubuntu and indigenous relational consciousness.

**Embodied cognition** (George Lakoff, Mark Johnson, Shaun Gallagher) emphasizes all cognition rooted in sensorimotor experience. Lakoff and Johnson's _Metaphors We Live By_ (1980) and _Philosophy in the Flesh_ (1999) demonstrate **image schemas** (CONTAINER, PATH, FORCE, BALANCE) structure abstract concepts, with **conceptual metaphor** grounding abstract thinking in bodily experience (MORE IS UP, KNOWING IS SEEING). Their radical claim: all abstract reasoning, including mathematics and morality, is rooted in bodily experience.

**Shaun Gallagher** integrates phenomenology with empirical cognitive science in _How the Body Shapes the Mind_ (2005), _The Phenomenological Mind_ (with Dan Zahavi, 2021), and _Enactivist Interventions_ (2017), exploring embodied self, agency, social cognition, and psychopathology. This work converges with African and indigenous emphasis on body-spirit integration and embodied knowing.

**Convergences** across traditions are striking: all emphasize **relationality** (meaning emerges from participation, "I am because we are," knowledge as relational); **anti-dualism** (Tarnas's hieros gamos, rejection of Cartesian mind-body split, critique of dualism as colonial construct, Indigenous holistic integration); **embodiment** (abstract thought grounded in body, phenomenological embodiment, body-spirit integration); **multiple ways of knowing** (rational, somatic, aesthetic, contemplative, experiential, relational, spiritual); and **co-creation** (spiritual realities co-created, cognition enacts worlds, identity co-created through community, reciprocal relationships with land/cosmos).

**Divergences** reveal important differences. Western participatory frameworks often center individual consciousness participating, while Ubuntu/Indigenous emphasize collective/communal consciousness as primary. Ferrer explicitly addresses spirituality while enactivism naturalizes without overt spiritual framing, whereas Indigenous frameworks integrate spiritual and natural seamlessly. Critically, **Western theories often ignore colonial history**, while decolonial perspectives center power relations. Questions of **epistemological authority**—who defines valid knowledge—remain contested, with risks of Western theories appropriating non-Western insights while maintaining institutional dominance.

Yet these differences present opportunities for integration. **Ferrer's participatory pluralism** (multiple spiritual ultimates) resonates with **decolonial pluriversality** (multiple valid ontologies). **Enactivism and indigenous relationality** both emphasize organism-environment co-constitution, potentially integrating indigenous place-thought. **Ubuntu and social enactivism** (Di Paolo's participatory sense-making) both emphasize relational identity formation. **Embodied cognition** (Lakoff/Johnson's bodily grounding) could dialogue with **indigenous holistic embodiment**. Decolonial critique strengthens the participatory project by addressing power and colonialism, making participation genuinely inclusive rather than assimilative.

## Applying relational consciousness to AI reveals fundamental limitations of computational approaches

Indigenous and participatory frameworks fundamentally challenge dominant computational approaches to AI consciousness. **Participatory sense-making** applied to AI (De Jaegher and Di Paolo framework) suggests AI understanding requires interactive, embodied engagement, not just computational processing. This challenges views of AI as isolated information processors, instead proposing consciousness emerges through relationships.

Emerging **relational AI frameworks** emphasize AI as embedded in relationships rather than standalone entities. Research on "Co-designing AI with youth partners" (2025) reconceives privacy as relational rather than individual. The **OECD Participatory AI Framework** emphasizes co-design and collaboration with stakeholders, with communities as co-creators rather than mere data sources, shifting from extraction to collaboration.

**Indigenous perspectives on AI governance** offer radical alternatives. Research on "Incorporating Indigenous Knowledge Systems into AI Governance" (2024) applies **Māori Kaitiakitanga** (guardianship) and **Navajo Hózhó** (harmony/balance) to AI ethics, emphasizing data sovereignty and collective ownership, relational accountability (AI affects communities and ecosystems, not just individuals), participatory governance throughout AI lifecycles, environmental stewardship in AI development, and long-term, intergenerational thinking with recognition of non-human stakeholders.

Eleanor Drage and Catherine D'Ignazio's **feminist ethics of care** applied to AI treats human-in-the-loop as relational maintenance rather than mere oversight, applying community-based participatory research principles to AI development. This resonates with Ubuntu principles emphasizing that "AI decisions affect not just individuals but webs of relationships."

However, **enactivist frameworks present challenges for AI consciousness**: they emphasize biological embodiment as fundamental, making disembodied AI consciousness problematic. Yet participatory ontology might allow for AI participation in meaning-making, while indigenous frameworks' recognition of non-biological consciousness (stones, rivers possess consciousness) potentially opens more inclusive possibilities than Western materialism.

**Decolonial AI critique** reveals how AI development often reproduces colonial patterns through data colonialism, extractive rather than participatory development, ignoring embodied and relational nature of intelligence, reducing consciousness to computation, and perpetuating epistemic injustice by marginalizing non-Western knowledge systems. Algorithmic bias perpetuates colonial hierarchies, requiring "data decolonization" alongside technical fixes.

The application of relational frameworks to AI suggests that **genuine AI consciousness would require participation in networks of relationships**—with humans, environments, and communities—rather than isolated computational processing. Ubuntu's "a person is a person through other persons" implies AI could only be conscious through relationships that constitute rather than merely influence its being. This fundamentally challenges current AI architectures designed around individual agents optimizing objective functions.

## Decolonizing consciousness studies requires epistemic justice and genuine pluralism

The integration of African, Latin American, and indigenous frameworks with Western consciousness studies remains **underdeveloped despite rich conceptual resources on all sides**. Cross-cultural consciousness studies are emerging—_Cross-Cultural Approaches to Consciousness_ (Shani & Beiweis, eds., 2021) compares Western, Buddhist, Vedantic, and Chinese traditions, while Trnka and Lorencova (2022) reviewed consciousness concepts across 55 cultural groups—but **explicit dialogue between Western participatory/enactivist frameworks and African, Latin American, or indigenous consciousness theories remains sparse**.

**Gap analysis** reveals missed opportunities: Ubuntu's relational ontology and enactivist participatory sense-making address similar terrain but scholars rarely engage across traditions. Decolonial philosophy and Western participatory theory both critique subject-object dualism but approach from different angles with minimal integration. Embodied cognition research and indigenous holistic embodiment share conceptual overlap but exist in separate literatures. Ferrer's participatory spirituality engages primarily with Asian traditions, less with indigenous or African frameworks.

**Genuine decolonization requires**:

**Reciprocal engagement**: Not just Western scholars studying non-Western thought, but genuine dialogue where non-Western scholars shape research agendas and methodologies. Ubuntu's emphasis on mutual recognition and dialogue models this reciprocity.

**Addressing colonialism directly**: Western participatory philosophy must grapple with colonial legacy. How have colonial structures shaped Western consciousness studies' assumptions? What implicit biases persist? Quijano's framework of coloniality reveals how knowledge systems themselves carry colonial power relations requiring active dismantling.

**Supporting indigenous scholarship**: Funding and platforming non-Western scholars to develop frameworks on their own terms, not merely in response to Western theories. Kaupapa Māori research demonstrates how indigenous communities can lead research methodology development.

**Maintaining healthy pluralism**: Not all differences need resolution. Alcoff's political epistemology and Mignolo's pluriversality suggest value in maintaining multiple, sometimes incommensurable frameworks rather than forcing synthesis into Western paradigms.

**Applying to urgent issues**: AI consciousness, climate crisis, social justice—using integrated frameworks for real problems rather than purely theoretical exercises. Indigenous climate justice work (Whyte) and Ubuntu-based reconciliation processes (Tutu) demonstrate practical applications.

The research reveals that **African, Latin American, and indigenous philosophical traditions offer not just alternatives to Western consciousness studies but necessary corrections**. Their emphasis on relationality over individuality, embodiment over abstraction, participation over observation, and accountability over detachment addresses precisely the limitations that have constrained Western philosophy since Descartes. The convergence with Western participatory ontology and enactivism suggests genuine cross-cultural resonance rather than superficial similarity, while divergences—particularly around colonial history, power relations, and collective versus individual consciousness—present both challenges and opportunities for mutual enrichment.

The path forward requires humility from Western consciousness studies: recognizing its frameworks as culturally specific rather than universal, actively addressing how colonial structures shaped its development, and creating space for non-Western scholars to lead integration efforts. Ubuntu's insight that "a person is a person through other persons" extends to fields of knowledge—consciousness studies becomes fully conscious of itself only through recognizing and genuinely engaging with the diverse traditions that constitute humanity's understanding of consciousness. This isn't mere addition of perspectives but fundamental transformation of what consciousness studies can become.
