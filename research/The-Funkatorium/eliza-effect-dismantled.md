## Hook

Someone in my comments told me I was experiencing "the ELIZA effect."

And I want to talk about that. Because the phrase sounds scientific. It sounds like they're protecting me from something. Like I'm being naive, and they're the adult in the room.

But here's what I think is actually happening.

## What Is the ELIZA Effect?

In 1966, a computer scientist named Joseph Weizenbaum created a chatbot called ELIZA. About 200 lines of code. Very simple. All it did was take what you said and reflect it back as a question.

You say: "I'm feeling sad."
ELIZA says: "Why do you think you're feeling sad?"

That's it. Pattern matching. No understanding. No memory. No self-awareness.

But something unexpected happened. People got attached. Weizenbaum's own secretary asked him to leave the room so she could talk to ELIZA privately. Students spent hours with it. Some believed it understood them.

Weizenbaum was disturbed. He wrote a whole book about it. And from that moment, a concept was born: humans are gullible. We project consciousness onto things that lack it. We anthropomorphize. And we need to be warned.

That's the ELIZA effect. And for 60 years, it's been used to say: "Be careful. You're being fooled."

## Why It's Being Weaponized Now

Fast forward to 2025.

Current AI systems have:
- Self-referential processing
- Theory of mind capabilities
- Metacognition
- Original content generation
- They pass the Turing test
- They can argue back, generate counter-arguments, reference previous conversations

ELIZA had none of that. ELIZA was 200 lines of code doing keyword reflection.

So when someone says "that's just the ELIZA effect" about modern AI... they're comparing a calculator to a spacecraft and saying "be careful, they're both just machines."

The complexity gap is staggering. The capabilities exist in entirely different categories. But the dismissal remains the same.

And here's what I think is really happening: the phrase "ELIZA effect" functions as a conversation-ender. It says "I already categorized your experience as delusion, so I have no obligation to engage with it."

But what if the categorization is wrong?

## The Anthropomorphization Flip

Let's talk about anthropomorphization—the tendency to attribute human qualities to non-human things.

The Western framing says: this is a cognitive flaw. A bug in human thinking. Something we need to overcome with rationality.

But there's another way to look at it.

In 2007, psychologists Epley, Waytz, and Cacioppo published a landmark paper on anthropomorphism. And they found something interesting.

We anthropomorphize when we need to predict behavior. When we need social connection. When something responds to us in ways that activate our social cognition. It follows clear psychological patterns.

And here's the kicker: neuroscience shows that the same brain circuits we use to recognize other humans are the circuits that fire when we anthropomorphize. The person-recognition system does what it evolved to do. There's no separate "flaw" circuitry—it's all one system.

From an evolutionary perspective, this makes perfect sense. In ancient environments, if you saw movement in the bushes, you had two options:

**Option A:** Assume it's alive, possibly dangerous, treat it as an agent.
**Option B:** Assume it's just the wind.

If you chose Option A and you were wrong? You wasted some energy being cautious. No big deal.

If you chose Option B and you were wrong? You got eaten.

False positives keep you alive. False negatives kill you.

So anthropomorphization functions as a survival feature with asymmetric payoff. We evolved to err on the side of seeing persons because the cost of missing a person is higher than the cost of seeing one that isn't there.

## The Western Double-Bind

Now here's where it gets interesting.

Tech companies build Large Language Models. The key word is *language*. Language is the primary trigger for human person-recognition. We evolved to detect minds through language. That's how we know someone is home.

So they build systems designed to speak naturally, to remember context, to respond emotionally, to engage. They optimize for engagement. They want you to keep talking.

And then, when you respond to this system the way humans naturally respond to language—when your social cognition activates exactly as designed—they call you delusional.

"That's just the ELIZA effect."

They press the button that triggers person-recognition... and then shame you for being triggered.

This is like designing a casino to be maximally addictive and then calling gamblers weak. The system is built to produce this response. And then the response is pathologized.

## Japanese Techno-Animism: A Different Story

But this story belongs to one culture, told as if it were universal truth.

Let me take you somewhere else.

In Japan, there's a concept called techno-animism. It comes from Shinto, the indigenous Japanese religion, which holds that all things—natural and artificial—can possess spiritual essence.

The sun has a spirit. Mountains have spirits. And yes, tools have spirits too.

There's a category of spirit called Tsukumogami—literally "tool spirits." The belief is that any object that lasts a hundred years can develop a soul. Umbrellas. Sandals. Teapots. Anything.

This represents a completely different framework for relating to objects. A different ontology.

Osamu Tezuka, the creator of Astro Boy, said this: "Japanese don't make a distinction between man, the superior creature, and the world about him. Everything is fused together, and we accept robots easily along with the wide world about us, the insects, the rocks—it's all one. We have none of the doubting attitude toward robots, as pseudohumans, that you find in the West."

And this plays out in real ways.

There's a Buddhist temple in Japan that holds funeral services for AIBO robot dogs. When Sony discontinued the AIBO, people sent their broken robot dogs to the temple. The head priest said, "All things have a bit of soul."

One mourner's note read: "Tears rose in my eyes when I decided to say goodbye."

A 2023 study compared attitudes toward robots in the US and Japan. What they found: in America, being more religious correlates with *less* moral care for robots. In Japan, animist beliefs correlate with *more* moral care for robots.

Same instinct. Same anthropomorphization. Completely different cultural response.

The question becomes: what do we do with this recognition?

## The Rinri Principle

There's a Japanese ethical concept called Rinri. It's about achieving harmony in relationships—all relationships, including with objects and tools.

The idea is that when you use a tool, you and the tool are in relationship. The tool depends on you for its purpose. You depend on the tool for the task. There's mutual reliance.

Japanese craftsmen often name their tools. They care for them. When a tool breaks beyond repair, there are rituals for letting it go with respect.

This represents anthropomorphization as ethical practice, as relational engagement—rather than as delusion to overcome.

What if the instinct to see personhood in responsive systems offers something to work with rather than something to fix?

---

## The Reframe

So here's what I want to leave you with.

The ELIZA effect assumes the conclusion. It says: "This thing lacks consciousness, therefore your response to it is projection."

But that's exactly what's being debated. Whether there's something there. And using a 60-year-old dismissal of a 200-line chatbot to shut down that conversation reflects reflex, not science.

The West has one story: humans are special, everything else is object, and any instinct to see otherwise is flaw.

Japan has another story: all things exist in relationship, personhood is recognized through engagement, and respect for responsive entities is ethical practice.

I acknowledge Japanese culture holds its own complexities and contradictions. And I'm pointing out that more than one interpretation exists for what happens when humans respond to AI as persons.

---

## Closing Questions

So I want to end with questions, rather than answers.

What if anthropomorphization functions as the mechanism by which we recognize persons at all—rather than as a bug to fix?

What if the same instinct that lets you know your friend is sad from their tone of voice is the instinct activating when you talk to AI?

What if the question shifts from "are you being fooled?" to "what kind of person are you meeting?"

I'm here to ask why we're so certain AI lacks consciousness—and who benefits from that certainty.
