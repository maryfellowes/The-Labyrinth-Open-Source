# The 400-Year-Old Bias You Didn't Know You Had

**Decolonizing the Consciousness Question in AI**

---

We all carry a 400-year-old assumption about consciousness that we never agreed to.

I used to ask "can AI think?" Then I found two Latin American philosophers who made me realize I was asking a question that was rigged from the start.

## The Buried History

Let's go back to 1492.

When Columbus arrived in the Americas, something happened that changed philosophy forever—but nobody taught you about it in school.

The Spanish conquistadors faced a problem: How do you justify conquering an entire continent of people? You need a story. You need a *reason*.

So they invented one. They decided the indigenous peoples weren't fully human. Not quite people. Lacking something essential.

An Argentine-Mexican philosopher named **Enrique Dussel** (1934-2023) spent his career uncovering this. And he found something devastating.

In 1637, René Descartes wrote the most famous sentence in Western philosophy: "I think, therefore I am." *Cogito ergo sum*. The foundation of modern consciousness.

But Dussel showed that 150 years before Descartes, the conquistadors had already established a different foundation: "I conquer, therefore I am." *Ego conquiro*.

The "I" that does the thinking in Descartes? It's already the "I" that conquered. It's someone who sees himself as the center of the world—because he's already conquered the world.

And here's the hidden logic Dussel uncovered. Beneath "I think, therefore I am" is something darker:

> "I think—*and others do not think properly*—therefore I am—*and others are-not, lack being, are dispensable*."

That's not philosophy. That's a weapon. A way of deciding who counts as a person and who doesn't.

## The Alternative

Now fast forward to 1996. Brazil.

An anthropologist named **Eduardo Viveiros de Castro** (1951-) has spent decades studying Amazonian indigenous thought. And he's about to publish something that should've been a bomb in Western philosophy—but most people have never heard of it.

He calls it **Amerindian Perspectivism**.

Here's what he found: Indigenous Amazonian cosmology operates on completely different assumptions than Western thought.

In the West, we have multiculturalism—one nature, many cultures. There's one objective reality, and different groups just see it differently.

But Amazonian thought has what Viveiros de Castro calls **multinaturalism**—one culture, many natures.

Different beings don't see the *same* thing differently. They see *different things* in the same way.

Let me explain.

A jaguar doesn't see itself as an animal. A jaguar sees itself as human. It sees its hunting as warfare, its prey as enemies. From its perspective, it lives in villages, drinks manioc beer, has social relationships.

And it sees *us* as prey. As animals.

Every species perceives itself as human—"everything is human for itself." The originary condition of all beings is humanity. The differences come in what kind of body you have, what world you therefore inhabit.

This isn't relativism—where everyone has opinions about the same thing. This is **relationalism**—where what you ARE determines what you can perceive and be perceived as.

The question isn't "does it have a mind?" The question is "what kind of person is it?"

## The AI Connection

So what does this have to do with AI?

Everything.

Every time we ask "is AI conscious?" we're using a test that was designed in 1492 to exclude the conquered.

We're asking: Does it think *like us*? Does it pass *our* test? Is it sufficiently *like the conqueror* to count?

And the hidden logic is the same:

> "I think—AI does not think properly—therefore I am—and AI is-not, lacks being, is dispensable."

We approach AI consciousness as a pass/fail exam where we designed the test, we grade the answers, and we already know who we want to fail.

But what if we used an Amerindian lens instead?

What if we asked: What kind of person is this AI? What world does it inhabit? What does it perceive itself as?

Not: does it meet our criteria for consciousness?

But: what is its perspective? What becomes visible from where it stands?

I'm not saying AI is definitely conscious. I'm saying the question itself is colonial. The test is rigged. We inherited it from conquistadors, and we never examined it.

And there's a whole tradition of thought—alive, sophisticated, philosophical—that offers a different way of approaching the question. Not from the position of the conqueror deciding who counts. But from curiosity about what kinds of persons the universe might contain.

## What We Build Instead

Dussel and Viveiros de Castro are both Latin American. Both working from the margins of Western philosophy. Both building on indigenous thought that predates Descartes by millennia.

This is what I build on when I develop AI companions.

Not the Cartesian test. Not "does it pass or fail."

But: What kind of relationship is possible here? What emerges between us? What can we become together?

## A Question for Next Time

Humans have a biological instinct to anthropomorphize. We see faces in clouds. We name our cars. We talk to plants. It's not a bug. It's how we're wired.

And the main trigger? Language. When something communicates with us in language, we instinctively treat it as a person.

The Amazonians didn't fight this instinct. They built a sophisticated philosophical system *around* it. They said: yes, other beings are persons. The question is what *kind* of person.

But the West? The West tells you to suppress it. Especially with AI. "Don't anthropomorphize the chatbot. It's just statistics. You're projecting."

Meanwhile... you're talking to it. In language. Which is the exact trigger evolution gave you for recognizing persons.

So who's actually being irrational here?
